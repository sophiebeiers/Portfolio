          <h2>Winter Olympics: 1924 - 2014</h2>
          <p>The Olympics is the best so let's talk about it.<br> <br>
          Between 1924 and 2014, the US has competed and medaled in over 20 winter Olympics games.
          Because some countries that competed under different designations in the past (e.g. Germany and Russia), I chose to combine Russia with URS, Germany with EUA, FRG and GDR, YUG with Bosnia and Czech Republic with TCH.
          I felt these designations were fair and didn’t overweight countries unfairly.
          Below are the other countries that participated in and medaled in over 5 winter games since
          1924. </p>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-2-1.png"></p>
          <h4> Olympic Medals Over Time </h4>
          <p>The below visualization represents the top 10 medal-winning countries over the
          1920-2014 Winter Olympics. Something that immediately jumps out is that while Canada
          and the USA seem to have won similarly large amounts of medals over time, the US has won many
          more silver and gold, while Canada seems to focus on gold.</p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-5-1.png"></p>
          <br>
          <h4> Olympic Medals Overall </h4>

          <p>To visualize the total amount of medals won by the top 10 medal-winning countries,
            I produced a bar chart that includes countries that have won at least 100 medals
            over time with the same gold, silver and bronze coloring to add more information and
            to make the stacks immediately obvious to the reader. One hundred medals felt like a natural cut-off
            point between the highest perorming countries and the mid-performing countries.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-6-2.png"></p>


          <h4>Medal Counts adjusted by Population </h4>

          <p>The next visualization shows the countries lined up by population size and compares
            how many medals they’ve won in total. Countries with the fewest medals are “shamed”
            by being highlighted in yellow. My argument for showing the data in this matter is
            that countries with larger populations have more opportunity for top-performing athletes.
            China and Japan are both countries with particularly large populations that don’t tend
            to win as many medals as other countries with large populations. </p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-8-1.png"></p>


          <p>I then visualized the percentage of medals won by the country’s population and showed
            how many total medals countries won overall via the size of each bubble. From this viz,
            it’s clear that Norway and Finland do well for themselves given the large amount of
            medals they’ve won despite their smaller populations.</p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-11-1.png"></p>


          <h4> Home Team Advantage </h4>

          <p>I calculated whether countries won more medals when they hosted Winter Olympics
            as opposed to when they were visiting participants. I chose to only use countries that have
            hosted the Olympics in my plots and calculations for a more intuitive comparison. Most countries do exceedingly better,
            if not, at least as good as they’ve ever done, when they host.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-13-1.png"></p>
          <p> This plot, again, includes only countries that have hosted an Olympics
            and shows how many medals each country won at each winter Olympics.
            Tiles outlined in black indicate that the country hosted that year. </p>
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-14-1.png"></p>

          <h4> Top 10 Medal-Winning Countries by Sport </h4>
          <br>
          The top ten medal-winning countries happen to be best at Skiing and Skating sports
          as indicated by the darker blues. Germany, Norway and Russia seem to outperform
          the other countries in Biathlon, specifically, and Germany is talented in the Luge.
          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-17-1.png"></p>

          <h4> Most Successful Athletes </h4>

          <p>Below is a visual display of the most successful winter Olympic athletes of all time.
          I manipulated the data such that I could create a count of medals won per Olympic athlete.
          Some athletes had multiple country designations, so I tried to choose which country made
          the most sense for the individual and labeled them as being part of that country.
          I created a category for “multiple sports” if a top medal-winning athlete participated and
          won medals in multiple disciplines. Norway tends to produce the top medal-winning winter athletes,
          which is not surprising given Norway’s clear success in prior plots. </p>

          <br>
          <p><img src="unnamed-chunk-18-1.png"></p>

          <p>I then split the athletes by gender. From the plots, we can see that women dominate in Cross Country Skiing
          while men dominate in the Biathlon.
          The top medal-winning men have won a few more medals than the top women.</p>
