## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
dogs <- read_csv("NYCDogs.csv")
```
### Overall 
```{r}
# ALL NAMES
names <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(dog_name) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE)
names <- names[-1,] # got rid of NA

```

### Gender
```{r}
names_by_gender <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(dog_name, gender) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE)
names_by_gender <- names_by_gender[-(1:2),] # got rid of NA
write_csv(names_by_gender, "names_gender.csv")

# MALE DOGS 
male_dogs <- names_by_gender %>% 
  filter(gender == "M")
write_csv(male_dogs, "male_dogs.csv")

# FEMALE DOGS 
female_dogs <- names_by_gender %>% 
  filter(gender == "F")
write_csv(female_dogs, "female_dogs.csv")
```

### Breeds
```{r}
breeds <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(breed) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE)

breeds_by_boro <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, breed) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(breed != "Mixed/Other")

bronx_breeds <- breeds_by_boro %>% 
  filter(borough == "Bronx") %>% 
  slice(1:5)
man_breeds <- breeds_by_boro %>% 
  filter(borough == "Manhattan") %>% 
  slice(1:5)
brook_breeds <- breeds_by_boro %>% 
  filter(borough == "Brooklyn") %>% 
  slice(1:5)
queens_breeds <- breeds_by_boro %>% 
  filter(borough == "Queens") %>% 
  slice(1:5)
staten_breeds <- breeds_by_boro %>% 
  filter(borough == "Staten Island") %>% 
  slice(1:5)
top5_breeds_boro <- rbind(bronx_breeds, man_breeds, brook_breeds, queens_breeds, staten_breeds)
write_csv(top5_breeds_boro, "top5breeds.csv")  
```

### Colors
```{r}
colors <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(dominant_color) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE)
write_csv(colors, "colors.csv")
```

### What dog do you have?
```{r}
guess <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, dog_name, gender, dominant_color) %>% 
  filter(dog_name != "n/a") %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(borough) %>% 
  top_n(n = 3)
write_csv(guess, "guess.csv")

bottom <- dogs %>% 
  group_by(borough, dog_name, gender, dominant_color) %>% 
  filter(dog_name != "n/a") %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(n == 1)
  
  
```
