          <h2><strong>California Freshmen: Where do they go?</strong></h2>
          <p>As a native Californian who remained in-state for college,
            I was intrigued by the NYT's 2016 article regarding where incoming freshmen
            tend to migrate out-of-state for a public university. The below map was based on data from NCES
            and visuals from <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/26/us/college-student-migration.html" target="_blank">
            "The Great Out-of-State Migration: Where Students Go." </a> </p>
          <p><img src="3_Flow.jpg" width= 98%></p>
          <p>According to the New York Times and Department of Ed data, freshman migration has almost doubled since 1986.
            Over 17,000 Californians, in specific, lost their minds (jokes) and went out of state for public school in 2016,
            while only roughly 4,700 students from other states moved into California. The New York Times cites one of the
            largest reasons
            freshmen leave California as simply not making the cut in terms of admission requirements in their home state
            schools. State schools in Texas, California and Illinois automatically admit top-10 students from the state, leaving
            those in the bottom 90% to often look elsewhere. The largest
            group of California-abandoners ended up in Arizona, and plenty left for neighboring states Oregon, Washington and Utah. Fewer
            made the cross-country trek.</p>
